## PHYSICS & COMPUTATION READING GROUP

This will be a reading group across Tufts, Harvard and MIT. The focus will be on analytic and probabilistic tools used to study the mathematical properties and algorithmic tractability of approximating (and sampling from statistics of) low-energy states of certain families of classical hamiltonians (spin glasses) and quantum hamiltonians (bosonic/fermionic systems).

**Meeting Time**: Thursdays, 11 AM - 1 PM EST

**Location**: TBA; Zoom link available upon request

**Organizers**: [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about), [Juspreet Singh Sandhu](https://juspreetsandhu.me)

## Relevant Papers

For a survey of Barvinok's method, a good reference are the "Computing Partition Functions" talks from the Simon's workshop on the [geometry of polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUjCLXPqW2Y&list=PLgKuh-lKre13XzHXH_rnq0ptd3ahU5TfB). A good historical reference for the overlap-gap property and its use in obstructing algorithms on random optimization problems is the survey by [Gamarnik](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14409.pdf). A more technical survey is [AMS22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10217.pdf). The three most accessible and comprehensive texts on the proof of the Parisi formula along with the applications of these techniques to solve other problems in mathematical and statistical physics are the books by Talagrand [Vol 1.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-15202-3), [Vol. 2](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-22253-5), and Panchenko [Pan13](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-6289-7).
