I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seas.harvard.edu%2Fcomputer-science&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGjg26QHPZ0TDV_KVdv3VHJ0ZsKYg">Harvard University</a>, fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fview%2Ftuftsqi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHcsMTHG5jtH46FfNZ8OHvDqzM97w">Peter Love</a>. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/toc-people-original">Theory of Computation</a> group at Harvard and the <a href="">Quantum Information Theory</a> group at Tufts. 

For most of Summer 2022, I was a visiting student at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/faculty+and+research/departments/Decision+Sciences/">Bocconi University</a> in Milan hosted by the wonderful Prof. <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/">Luca Trevisan</a>. I spent the remaining time of Summer 2022 at UC Santa-Barbara, attending the workshop on <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigoda/School/">Spectral Indepenence and Entropy Decay</a>.

I am generally interested in **Theoretical Computer Science** and **Mathematical Physics**. More specifically, my interests lie somewhere in the union of High-Dimensional Probability, Algorithmic Spin-Glass Theory, Quantum Information Theory, Sum-of-Squares Optimization, Discrete Harmonic Analysis and Random Matrix Theory.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kensho.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFFNoPaarKyKr6fU23OmUQpKrbyxQ">Kensho, Inc.</a> in the Graph-Infrastructure team. I finished my undergraduate studies from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fphysics.illinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRHJYVorx2ldFR6JEe1PHQjmt3oA">UIUC</a> with a BS in Physics, and minors in Computer Science & Mathematics.
