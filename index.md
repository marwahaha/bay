I am a post-doctoral scholar at <a href="https://tcs.soe.ucsc.edu/trg">UC Santa Cruz</a>, hosted by Prof. <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~akolla/">Alexandra Kolla</a>. In August 2025, I will join the department of computer science at <a href="https://compsci.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a> as an assistant professor.

My research focuses on _algorithmic_ and _mathematical_ problems at the intersection of **probability theory**, **non-commutative geometry/analysis**, and **mathematical physics**.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seas.harvard.edu%2Fcomputer-science&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGjg26QHPZ0TDV_KVdv3VHJ0ZsKYg">Harvard University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fview%2Ftuftsqi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHcsMTHG5jtH46FfNZ8OHvDqzM97w">Peter Love</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a>, within the <a href="https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/people/juspreet-sandhu">theory of computation</a> and <a href="">quantum information theory</a> groups.

In Summer 2022, I visited Prof. <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/">Luca Trevisan</a> at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/faculty+and+research/departments/Decision+Sciences/">Bocconi University</a> and attended the program on <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigoda/School/">spectral indepenence and entropy decay</a>. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kensho.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFFNoPaarKyKr6fU23OmUQpKrbyxQ">Kensho, Inc.</a> on the graph-infrastructure team. I hold a B.S. in physics, with minors in mathematics and computer science, from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fphysics.illinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRHJYVorx2ldFR6JEe1PHQjmt3oA">UIUC</a>.
