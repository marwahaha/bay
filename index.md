I am a post-doctoral scholar at <a href="https://tcs.soe.ucsc.edu/trg">UC Santa Cruz</a> hosted by the wonderful Prof. <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~akolla/">Alexandra Kolla</a>.

I did my PhD at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seas.harvard.edu%2Fcomputer-science&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGjg26QHPZ0TDV_KVdv3VHJ0ZsKYg">Harvard University</a>, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Fview%2Ftuftsqi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHcsMTHG5jtH46FfNZ8OHvDqzM97w">Peter Love</a> and co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a> as part of the <a href="https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/people/juspreet-sandhu">Theory of Computation</a> and <a href="">Quantum Information Theory</a> groups. 
 
In Summer 2022, I visited Prof. <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/">Luca Trevisan</a> at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/faculty+and+research/departments/Decision+Sciences/">Bocconi University</a> in Milan and attended the program on <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigoda/School/">Spectral Indepenence and Entropy Decay</a>.

I am broadly interested at the intersection of **Theoretical Computer Science**, **Mathematical Physics** and **Probability Theory**. For more details, see <a href="https://juspreetsandhu.me/publications">here</a>.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kensho.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFFNoPaarKyKr6fU23OmUQpKrbyxQ">Kensho, Inc.</a> in the Graph-Infrastructure team. I got my Bachelors in Physics (with minors in Mathematics & Computer Science) from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fphysics.illinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRHJYVorx2ldFR6JEe1PHQjmt3oA">UIUC</a>.
