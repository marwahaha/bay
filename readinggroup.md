In _Spring-2023_, there will be a reading group on *Physics and Computation* across Tufts, Harvard and MIT. The focus will be on analytic and probabilistic tools used to study the mathematics and algorithmic tractability of approximating and sampling low-energy states of certain families of classical hamiltonians (spin glasses) and quantum hamiltonians (bosonic/fermionic systems).

**Meeting Time**: Thursdays, 11 AM - 1 PM EST

**Location**: TBA

**Organizers**: [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about), [Juspreet Singh Sandhu](https://juspreetsandhu.me)

## Relevant Papers
For a survey of Barvinok's method, a good reference are the "Computing Partition Functions" talks from the Simon's workshop on the [geometry of polynomials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUjCLXPqW2Y&list=PLgKuh-lKre13XzHXH_rnq0ptd3ahU5TfB). A good historical reference for the overlap-gap property and its use in obstructing algorithms on random optimization problems is the [survey by Gamarnik](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14409.pdf). A more technical survey is the one by [Auffinger, Montanari and Subag](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10217.pdf).
