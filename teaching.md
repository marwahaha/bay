In Winter-2024, I taught a seminar course on a recent result with [Jonathan Shi](https://www.jshi.science/#Overview) in which we developed a new sum-of-squares hierarchy to certify properties of random instances of optimization problems. The class was [CSE-280: Sum-of-Squares and Gaussian Processes](https://juspreetsandhu.me/cse280).


I have been fortunate in my time as a PhD to be a Teaching Fellow for many classes. A few of those are listed below:

1. [CS-229BR, Fall-2022](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chlee/cs229br/): Boolean Fourier Analysis. Instructor - [Chin-Ho Lee](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chlee/).  
2. [AM-105, Spring-2020](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/100117): Differential Equations. Instructor - [Prof. Margo Levine](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/margo-levine). 
3. [AM-250, Fall-2019](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/links/es-250-information-theory): Information Theory. Instructor - [Prof. Flavio Calmon](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/#teaching). 
4. [AM-104, Fall-2019](https://scholar.harvard.edu/efthimios_kaxiras/applied-mathematics-104): Complex Analysis. Instructor - [Prof. Kaxiras](https://scholar.harvard.edu/efthimios_kaxiras).
