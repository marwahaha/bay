Teaching pure mathematics, theoretical computer science or mathematical physics to a motivated, energetic and creative group of students is a great way to learn.
To that extent, I have been fortunate in my time as a PhD to be a Teaching Fellow for many classes. A few of those are listed below:

1. [CS-229BR, Fall-2022](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chlee/cs229br/): Boolean Fourier Analysis. Instructor - [Chin-Ho Lee](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chlee/).  
2. [AM-105, Spring-2020](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/100117): Differential Equations. Instructor - [Prof. Margo Levine](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/margo-levine). 
3. [AM-250, Fall-2019](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/links/es-250-information-theory): Information Theory. Instructor - [Prof. Flavio Calmon](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/#teaching). 
4. [AM-104, Fall-2019](https://scholar.harvard.edu/efthimios_kaxiras/applied-mathematics-104): Complex Analysis. Instructor - [Prof. Kaxiras](https://scholar.harvard.edu/efthimios_kaxiras).
