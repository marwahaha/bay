The blog posts here are about topics I regularly encounter in research. Mostly, the content is around **Spin-Glass Theory**, **Stochastic Analysis**, **Variational Optimization** & **Partial Differential Equations**. I may also write a few blog-posts explaining some recent papers - In that case, the post will have the prefix "**Paper Exposition**" in the title.
