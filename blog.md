The blog posts here contain posts about topics I encounter in research regularly. Mostly, the content is around <b>Spin-Glass Theory</b>, <b>Stochastic Analysis</b>, <b>Variational Optimization</b> & <b>Partial Differential Equations</b>. I may also write a blog-post explaining a recent paper - In such a case, it will be prefixed as "<b>Paper Exposition</b>".
