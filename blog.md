The blog posts here are about topics I regularly encounter in research. Mostly, the content is around <b>Spin-Glass Theory</b>, <b>Stochastic Analysis</b>, <b>Variational Optimization</b> & <b>Partial Differential Equations</b>. I may also write a few blog-posts explaining some recent papers - In that case, the post will have the prefix "<b>Paper Exposition</b>" in the title.
