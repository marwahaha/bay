My hobbies generally revolve in the realm of music, travelling and/or sports.

* **Classical Music**: Iâ€™ve been studying Classical Guitar since 2006. I play a Cordoba-C9 for now (Cedar Top).
* **Badminton**: I was a competitive badminton player in a previous life. I played Zonals and State-Level Badminton in India, and was part of the A-Team at UIUC.
* **Photography**: I am particularly fond of Nature Photography, Black-and-White Photography and DSLRs with High-Shutter Speeds. A [sample](https://juspreetsandhu.me/photography) of my photography.
