My papers can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IkxViPsAAAAJ) or [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/299/8207.html). I (primarily) work with:
* [David Jekel](https://davidjekel.com/) and [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) to design spectral algorithms that optimize spin glasses, operator-valued polynomials & CSPs via the study of Gaussian processes on symmetric domains (such as compact Lie groups). We also design & analyze sum-of-squares hierarchies that certify algorithmic thresholds in random optimization.
* [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about) to develop & extend probabilistic techniques from mathematical spin-glass theory with complex-analytic ideas to study mathematical and algorithmic questions surrounding the random-permanent problem.
* [Ewan Davies](https://www.ewandavies.org/) to extend the theory of local occupancy to include information about higher moments of Gibbs measures, and study the implications of this on the hard-core model on explicit families of graphs.
