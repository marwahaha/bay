This is the third (and final) blog post in a **3-part** series, themed on a recent result [[JSS24]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02360) by [David](https://davidjekel.com/), [Jonathan](https://jshi.science/) and me. The first blog post can be found [here](https://juspreetsandhu.me/2024/08/08/hessian-ascent-for-the-sk-model-i), and the second one can be found [here](https://juspreetsandhu.me/2024/08/12/hessian-ascent-for-the-sk-model-ii).

A quick recap of what we accomplished in the second blog post:
1. We proved the first major component in the analysis of the PHA algorithm on the SK model: the construction and desirable properties of the projector $$P_j(D)^2 $$ into the top-eigenspace of the TAP corrected Hessian.
2. We then overviewed the second major component in the analysis of the PHA algorithm on the SK model: the proof that the empirical distribution of the coordinates of every iterate of the algorithm converge, with high probability, to the (primal) Auffinger-Chen SDE.
