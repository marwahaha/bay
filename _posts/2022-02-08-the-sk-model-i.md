The goal of this post is to introduce the _Sherrington-Kirkpatrick_ model, which is the canonical starting point in Spin-Glass Theory. This model (along with a slightly generalized family) is one of the first models for which the infamous _Parisi-Variational Principle_ was (formally) proven to be true. It is also a model that instigated the initiation of many other concepts via the _Replica-Symmetry Breaking_ ansatzen such as _Ultrametricity_, the _TAP Equations_, and the _Ghirlanda-Guerra Identities_. It is the prototypical model of a **Mean-Field Spin Glass** and has recently had algorithmic implications, which in conjunction with the growing body of work on the _Overlap-Gap Property_ have created an insteresting line of work that shed lights on the average-case complexity of a large family of optimization problems[^1].
