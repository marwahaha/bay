# CSE-280: SUM-OF-SQUARES (SoS) & GAUSSIAN PROCESSES

This will be a one-quarter (Winter-2024) seminar course discussing a recent result ([I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14383),[II]()) by [Jonathan Shi](https://www.jshi.science/#Overview) and myself. The main contribution of this result is that it introduces a new SoS hierarchy to optimize certain Gaussian processes and efficiently certify the values of their expected supremum to some (constant) threshold of approximability. The threshold is widely-believed to be optimal among polynomial-time algorithms. The paper also makes a conjecture about the optimality of this hierarchy for a broad class of Gaussian processes, providing examples of modified Gaussian processes where the HES hierarchy provably outperforms local-iterative algorithms such as Hessian ascent (or provides strong evidence of doing so). Proving (or disproving) this conjecture would unravel interesting connections between high-dimensional probability, sum-of-squares, random matrices and free probability.
