I work very closely with [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) on obstructing algorithms (such as low-degree polynomials (LDPs), local quantum algorithms and diffusion dynamics) in the presence of ultrametric OGPs, and designing unifying sum-of-squares (SoS) algorithms for optimizing spin glasses and Max-CSPs under fRSB. The motivation for our work is to develop a unified theory of typical-instance complexity for optimization and understand its ramifications on quantum advantage, the small-set expansion hypothesis/unique-games conjecture and a possible SoS version of a proof of the Parisi formula. <br/>

Some questions and techniques that excite me include the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7495.pdf">qPCP conjecture</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07847.pdf">ultrametric OGPs</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03006.pdf">Guerra-Tonnineli interpolations</a>, <a href="https://www.dsteurer.org/paper/expansion.pdf">small-set expansion/unique-games conjectures</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02337.pdf">analytic sparsity proofs</a>.
