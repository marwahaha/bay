I currently work very closely with the evergreen [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) on a set of problems at the intersection of <strong> Replica-Symmetry Breaking </strong>, the <strong>Sum-of-Squares</strong> framework, <strong>Spectral Graph Theory</strong>, <strong>Quantum Algorithms</strong> and <strong>Stochastic Analysis</strong>. I've also worked on some problems in the past with [Chi-Ning Chou](https://cnchou.github.io/) and [Emil T. Khabiboulline](https://ekhabiboulline.me/).
