My papers can be found on [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/299/8207.html) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2G4gViMAAAAJ).
<br/>

I primarily work with:
* [David Jekel](https://davidjekel.com/) and [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) on designing spectral algorithms and unifying sum-of-squares relaxations for certifying and optimizing spin glasses, operator-valued polynomials & CSPs, and more generally extending the theory of the Parisi formula to different geometries.
* [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about) on developing and extending probabilistic techniques from mathematical spin-glass theory with complex-analytic ideas to systematically study the mathematical and algorithmic questions surrouring the "random permanent" problem.
* [Alexandra Kolla](https://people.ucsc.edu/~akolla/) and [Zack Jorquera](https://zackjorquera.github.io/) on initiating the algorithmic study of certain families of local quantum hamiltonians using the non-commutative sum-of-squares hierarchy.
<br/>

More broadly, I am interested in using/developing ideas and techniques from free probability, stochastic analysis, optimal transport, harmonic analysis and sum-of-squares hiearchies to solve problems in theoretical computer science and mathematical physics.
