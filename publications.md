I currently work very closely with the evergreen [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) on obstructing large families of algorithms (such as low-degree polynomials, local quantum algorithms and diffusion dynamics) in the presence of ultrametric-style OGPs, and in designing unifying Sum-of-Squares algorithms for optimizing mean-field spin glasses and Max-CSPs under fRSB. Much of the motivation for our work is to develop a unified theory of typical-instance complexity for combinatorial optimization and understand its ramifications on quantum advantage.
