My papers can be found on [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/299/8207.html) or [current Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=1&user=2G4gViMAAAAJ) (to be updated in future to [this](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IkxViPsAAAAJ)). I primarily work with:
* [David Jekel](https://davidjekel.com/) and [Jonathan Shi](https://jshi.science/) on designing spectral algorithms and sum-of-squares relaxations for certifying and optimizing spin glasses, operator-valued polynomials & CSPs, and more generally extending the theory of the Parisi formula to different geometries.
* [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about) on developing and extending probabilistic techniques from mathematical spin-glass theory with complex-analytic ideas to systematically study the mathematical and algorithmic questions surrounding the "random permanent" problem.
* [Alexandra Kolla](https://people.ucsc.edu/~akolla/) and [Zack Jorquera](https://zackjorquera.github.io/) on initiating the algorithmic study of certain families of local quantum hamiltonians using the non-commutative sum-of-squares hierarchy.
<br/>

More broadly, I am interested in using/developing ideas and techniques in _free probability_, _stochastic analysis_, _optimal transport_, _harmonic analysis_ and _sum-of-squares hierarchies_ to solve problems in **theoretical computer science** and **mathematical physics**.
